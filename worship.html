	    <h3>Worship</h3>
	    <p>Worship is about lifting up the Lord Jesus and keeping Him firmly in the centre of everything we do. We want to be continually moving into deeper relationship with Him and to give more and more of ourselves to lifting Him high.</p>

	      <p class="smaller" style="margin-left: 20px">We currently have two worship teams who normally lead us in a time of musical worship at beginning of our Sunday services. We currently supplement this from time to time by using digital media to facilitate our worship. We are seeking to expand our worship teams.</p>
