	    <h3>Wantage Christian Fellowship</h3>
	    <p>We are an evangelical, fellowship style church that currently meets in the <a id="wcf_link_style" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?&z=10&q=51.5858796+-1.4292202&ll=51.5858796+-1.4292202">6th form centre of King Alfred's Academy</a>. Although independent, we enjoy an affiliation to the <a id="wcf_link_style" href="http://www.scba.org.uk/">Southern Counties Baptist Association</a>.
	    </p>
	    <h3>Values</h3>
	    <ul>
	      <li>To honour the Lord Jesus Christ</li>
	      <p class="smaller" style="margin-left: 20px">Our fellowship belongs to Jesus and puts Him at the centre of all we do. When we meet together we always talk about Him, we worship Him, we serve Him and we reverence Him.</p>
	      <li>To live in community</li>
	      <p class="smaller" style="margin-left: 20px">The strength of relationships within the fellowship and the genuine love we have for each other is frequently the first thing mentioned by visitors to the church. </p>
	      <li>To love and serve our town</li>
	      <p class="smaller" style="margin-left: 20px">We have a heart for Wantage and Grove. This is where God has put us and we want to be a blessing and bring in the Kingdom of God where we are. We are blessed to be involved in global missionary work through our relationship with the <a id="wcf_link_style" href="https://www.bmsworldmission.org/">Baptist Missionary Society</a>.</p>
