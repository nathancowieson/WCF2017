Website layout for Wantage Christian Fellowship using bootstrap and a few plugins poached from various places
to use grab this repo and you'll have to add:

css/bootstrap.css
css/ie10-viewport-bug-workaround.css

js/bootstrap.min.js
js/jquery.min.js
js/ie-emulation-modes-warning.js

Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com/) and JQuery (https://jquery.com/) should sort you out for those things.
