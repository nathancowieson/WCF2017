	    <h3>Kids Work</h3>
	    <p>We are committed to discipling children and young people and supporting families and family life.</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>Chreche and kids in our Sunday Services</li>
	      <p class="smaller" style="margin-left: 20px">Church is family and children of all ages are welcome to be part of our Sunday services, under the supervision of their parents, even if this means a bit of background noise and occasional commotion! A creche area is provided to one side of the main meeting and this will usually staffed by a friendly volunteer to help entertain and look after children of pre-school age.</p>
	      <li>Sunday school</li>
	      <p class="smaller" style="margin-left: 20px">Usually, children of primary school age remain in the main service until after our worship time when they can go to an adjacent classroom for age approriate activities and fun! The Sunday school curiculum matches what the rest of the church is learning so that we can continue to be one church with one direction and vision. The Sunday school is staffed at all times by two adult members of the church community for child protection.</p>
	      <li>Conker Cafe</li>
	      <p class="smaller" style="margin-left: 20px">Conker Cafe is an outreach event run by the church on a Saturday night to provide a safe environment for primary school aged children in the area to get together and have fun. We have had a temporary break from Conker Cafe this last year but intend to bring it back very soon.</p>
